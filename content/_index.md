# Cargo-AI

**Lightweight AI agents. Built in Rust. Declared in JSON.**

Cargo-AI is an open-source framework that turns simple JSON definitions into working AI agents you can run anywhere.  
Each configuration file becomes a compiled Rust binary — lightweight, fast, and fully under your control.

```bash
cargo ai hatch agent_x --config agent_x.json
```

### Why it matters
- **No Code** – Define logic in JSON; Cargo-AI handles the Rust.  
- **Local Control** – Works with OpenAI or Ollama, runs entirely on your machine.  
- **Lightweight & Scalable** – Runs on servers, laptops, or embedded devices.  
- **Shareable** – Agents are just JSON; it’s as easy as sharing a file.  

### Get Involved
Cargo-AI is in active development — open, transparent, and ready to explore.  
If it sparks your curiosity, **star or follow it on GitHub**, or suggest an agent you’d like to see demoed.
